# Overview

This is a simple Guess the Number game written in Java, with a GUI using JavaFX.
I have never used Java before so setting up the JDK and IntelliJ IDE took some time and 
then I created a command line version using pure Java. After creating the basic version I
added easy, medium, and hard difficulties. Finally, I installed JavaFX and copied my code over
into a GameWindow class and added a GUI.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDE, Java, and JavaFX. I used a number of libraries including ArrayList, 
List, and Random from Java and Application, Scene, Control, Layout, and Stage from JavaFX.

# Future Work

- Add colors/effects when the number is higher, lower, or correct.
- Fix formatting, i.e. size of the GUI window to include all text.
- Ideally I'd like other guessing games like wordle or guess the color sequence
